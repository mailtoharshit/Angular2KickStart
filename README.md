# Angular 2 KickStart Project
> This code is based of purely from the [Angular 2 Tutorial](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html).

## Description
This repository acts as a very simple Angular 2 Beta KickStart Code with which you can get started developing Angular 2 immediately.
It is derived from the official Angular 2 Documentation which can be found [here](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html).

## Usage
Follow the following steps and you're good to go! Important: Typescript and npm has to be installed on your machine!
1: Clone repo
```
git clone hhttps://github.com/mailtoharshit/Angular2KickStart.git
```
2: Since I uploaded npm-packages, you don't need to install anything (update packages when you run)
```
npm update
```
3: Start server (includes auto refreshing)
```
npm start
```
4: Start Gulp Watcher (compile TypeScript and (S)CSS)
